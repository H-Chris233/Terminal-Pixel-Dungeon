# Implementation Summary: Event Bus Taxonomy and Turn-Phase Integration

## Ticket Requirements

✅ **All ticket requirements completed successfully**

### 1. ✅ Compare and Add Missing Event Categories

**Implemented:**
- Created `EventCategory` enum with 10 categories:
  - Combat, Movement, Status, Items, AI, Environment, UI, System, TurnPhase, Action
- Added `category()` method to all `GameEvent` variants
- Added **30 new event variants** across categories:
  - 4 Action intent/result events
  - 7 Advanced combat outcome events
  - 6 Status lifecycle events
  - 8 Environment trigger events
  - 5 UI cue events

**Files Modified:**
- `src/event_bus.rs` - Added EventCategory enum and new event variants

### 2. ✅ Per-Phase Event Queues with Priority

**Implemented:**
- `TurnPhase` enum: Input, IntentQueue, Resolution, Aftermath, Any
- `PriorityEventEntry` struct with priority and sequence tracking
- Phase-based event queues: `HashMap<TurnPhase, BinaryHeap<PriorityEventEntry>>`
- Priority ordering: Critical > High > Normal > Low > Lowest
- FIFO ordering within same priority level
- Safeguards against recursive publishing:
  - Publish depth tracking (max 10 levels)
  - Batch buffer for events exceeding depth
  - Automatic flush when depth returns to 0

**Files Modified:**
- `src/event_bus.rs` - Added phase queue infrastructure

**Key Methods:**
- `publish_to_phase(event, priority, phase)`
- `drain_phase(phase) -> Vec<GameEvent>`
- `set_current_phase(phase)`
- `get_current_phase() -> TurnPhase`

### 3. ✅ Phase-Aware Handlers

**Implemented:**
- Extended `EventHandler` trait with `run_in_phases()` method
- Phase-specific handler registration: `phase_handlers: HashMap<TurnPhase, Vec<HandlerEntry>>`
- Handler filtering by phase during event dispatch
- Support for handlers that run in multiple phases

**Files Modified:**
- `src/event_bus.rs` - Updated EventHandler trait and registration

**Key Methods:**
- `subscribe_for_phase(phase, handler)`
- `subscribe_with_phases(handler)`
- `process_phase_events(phase)`

### 4. ✅ Update ECSWorld::handle_core_event

**Implemented:**
- Added handling for all 30 new event types
- Graceful fallthrough for unknown events (backward compatibility)
- No panics when loading legacy saves
- Comprehensive message log updates for new events

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ecs.rs` - Enhanced `handle_core_event()` method

**Features:**
- Action events → message log
- Advanced combat → detailed combat feedback
- Status lifecycle → status notifications
- Environment events → interaction feedback
- UI events → notifications and alerts

### 5. ✅ Targeted Tests

**Implemented:**
- Created comprehensive test suite: `tests/event_bus_taxonomy_tests.rs`
- **12 passing tests** covering:
  1. Event categorization (all categories tested)
  2. Priority event ordering
  3. Phase-aware event queues
  4. Multiple phase queues
  5. Phase-aware handlers
  6. Middleware short-circuit behavior
  7. Recursive publishing protection
  8. FIFO ordering within same priority
  9. Current phase tracking
  10. Event history with new events
  11. Backward compatibility
  12. Full turn cycle integration

**Test Results:**
```

## Code Quality

- ✅ All tests pass (12 new + 56 existing lib tests)
- ✅ Workspace builds successfully
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Backward compatible API
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Well-tested infrastructure

## Architecture Highlights

### Event Processing Flow

```
1. Event Published → Phase Queue (with priority)
2. Phase Queue → BinaryHeap (sorted by priority, then FIFO)
3. drain_phase() → Events in priority order
4. process_phase_events() → Dispatch to phase-aware handlers
5. Handlers filtered by phase → Only relevant handlers run
```

### Recursive Publishing Protection

```
publish_to_phase()
  ↓
Check depth < max_depth?
  Yes → Add to queue, increment depth
  No → Add to batch_buffer
  ↓
depth == 0?
  Yes → flush_batch_buffer()
```

### Backward Compatibility

```
Old Code:
  event_bus.publish(event)
  ↓
Still works! Events added to both:
  - Traditional queue (Vec)
  - Phase queue (BinaryHeap)
```

## Integration Points

The enhanced event bus integrates seamlessly with:

1. **Turn System** (`src/turn_system.rs`)
   - TurnPhase enum matches turn system phases
   - Phase-aware event processing aligns with turn phases

2. **ECS World** (`src/ecs.rs`)
   - handle_core_event() processes all event types
   - No breaking changes to existing integration

3. **Game Loop** (`src/game_loop.rs`)
   - Can leverage phase-aware processing
   - Traditional event handling still works

## Future Enhancements (Potential)

While not required for this ticket, these could be future improvements:

1. Event filtering by category in handlers
2. Event recording and replay system
3. Async event processing support
4. Event compression/merging for performance
5. Event analytics and metrics dashboard

## Conclusion

✅ **All ticket requirements successfully implemented and tested**

The event bus now supports:
- ✅ Expanded taxonomy with 30 new events
- ✅ Category-based event grouping
- ✅ Per-phase priority queues
- ✅ Phase-aware handler execution
- ✅ Recursive publishing protection
- ✅ Middleware short-circuit behavior
- ✅ Backward compatibility with legacy code
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Complete documentation

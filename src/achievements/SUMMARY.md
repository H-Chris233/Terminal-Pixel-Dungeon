# Achievements Crate - Implementation Summary

## Completed Features

### 1. Core Data Structures ✅

#### Achievement Entities
- **AchievementId**: Enum with 16 predefined achievement types (kills, exploration, collection, survival, misc)
- **Achievement**: Struct with id, name, description, criteria, and unlocked status
- **AchievementCriteria**: Enum supporting multiple criteria types (kill count, depth, items, turns, bosses, gold)
- **AchievementProgress**: Tracks all player progress metrics

All structs support:
- Full serde serialization/deserialization (JSON)
- Full bincode serialization/deserialization (binary)
- Clone, Debug traits
- Proper visibility (pub fields where appropriate)

### 2. AchievementsManager Interface ✅

**Registration**:
- `new()` - Creates manager and auto-registers all achievements
- `all_achievements()` - Returns all achievement definitions

**Progress Updates**:
- `on_kill()` - Handle enemy kill event
- `on_level_change(depth)` - Handle level/depth change
- `on_item_pickup()` - Handle item pickup event
- `on_turn_end(turn)` - Handle turn counter update
- `on_boss_defeat()` - Handle boss defeat event
- `on_gold_collected(amount)` - Handle gold collection

**Querying**:
- `is_unlocked(id)` - Check if achievement is unlocked
- `unlocked_achievements()` - Get all unlocked achievements
- `locked_achievements()` - Get all locked achievements
- `get_achievement(id)` - Get specific achievement
- `unlock_percentage()` - Get unlock progress (0.0-1.0)

**Notification System**:
- `peek_newly_unlocked()` - View newly unlocked without clearing
- `drain_newly_unlocked()` - Get and clear newly unlocked

**Utility**:
- `progress()` - Get read-only progress
- `progress_mut()` - Get mutable progress
- `reset()` - Reset all progress and achievements

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture ✅

All update methods (`on_*`) follow the same pattern:
1. Update progress tracker
2. Check all achievements against criteria
3. Unlock eligible achievements
4. Add newly unlocked to notification queue
5. Return list of newly unlocked IDs

This design integrates seamlessly with the game's event bus system.

### 4. Serialization Support ✅

**Serde (JSON)**:
- All types fully serializable
- `newly_unlocked` field skipped (transient notification state)

**Bincode (Binary)**:
- All types support bincode Encode/Decode
- Optimized for save game persistence
- `newly_unlocked` uses serde compatibility layer

### 5. Achievement Tiers ✅

Multi-tier achievements implemented:
- **Slayer**: I (10), II (50), III (100) kills
- **Exploration**: DeepDiver (5), Spelunker (10), MasterExplorer (20) depth
- **Collection**: Hoarder (10), Collector (50), TreasureHunter (100) items
- **Survival**: Survivor (100), Veteran (500), Legend (1000) turns

### 6. Comprehensive Testing ✅

**22 Unit Tests** covering:

**Serialization Tests** (8 tests):
- JSON serialization for all types
- Bincode serialization for all types
- Roundtrip testing
- Enum variant serialization
- Empty manager serialization

**Progress Logic Tests** (6 tests):
- Kill tracking
- Depth tracking (max only)
- Item collection
- Saturating arithmetic
- Reset functionality
- Multi-metric accuracy

**Manager Tests** (8 tests):
- Registration and initialization
- Update progress methods
- Query unlocked achievements
- Achievement tiers progression
- Multiple criteria independence
- Event-driven updates
- Notification queue
- Persistence simulation

All tests pass ✅

## Project Structure

├── Cargo.toml           # Dependencies: serde, bincode, serde_json (dev)
├── README.md            # User documentation and examples
├── SUMMARY.md           # This file

    ├── lib.rs           # AchievementsManager and public API

```

## Public API

```rust
pub use achievement::{Achievement, AchievementCriteria, AchievementId, all_achievements};
pub use criteria::AchievementProgress;
pub struct AchievementsManager { ... }
```

## Integration Points

The achievements crate is designed to integrate with:

1. **Event Bus**: Subscribe to game events (kills, level changes, item pickups, etc.)
2. **Save System**: Serialize/deserialize with bincode for save games
3. **UI System**: Query unlocked achievements and newly unlocked for notifications
4. **Game Loop**: Update progress based on gameplay events

## Dependencies

- **serde** 1.0.219 - JSON serialization support
- **bincode** 2.0.1 - Binary serialization for save games
- **serde_json** 1.0.140 (dev-only) - Test JSON serialization

## Workspace Integration

Added to root `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[workspace]
members = [
    # ... other members
    "src/achievements",
]

[dependencies]
achievements = { path = "src/achievements", version = "0.1.0" }
```

## Future Considerations

Potential enhancements documented in README:
- Custom achievement definitions from config
- Time-based achievements
- Hidden achievements
- Achievement rewards system
- Platform integration (Steam, etc.)

## Ticket Requirements Checklist

✅ Created workspace member `src/achievements`  
✅ Defined achievement entities (id, name, description, criteria, tiers)  
✅ Implemented progress tracking (AchievementProgress)  
✅ Added serde support (all types Serialize/Deserialize)  
✅ Added bincode support (all types Encode/Decode)  
✅ Created AchievementsManager interface  
✅ Implemented register definitions (via `all_achievements()`)  
✅ Implemented update progress (via `on_*` methods)  
✅ Implemented query unlocked (multiple query methods)  
✅ Prepared event-driven hooks (6 event handlers)  
✅ Provided unit tests for serialization (8 tests)  
✅ Provided unit tests for progress logic (14 tests)  
✅ All 22 tests passing  

## Notes

- The `newly_unlocked` field uses `#[serde(skip_serializing)]` to avoid persisting transient state
- Achievement criteria checking is centralized in `Achievement::check_unlock()`
- Progress tracking uses saturating arithmetic to prevent overflow
- All event handlers return newly unlocked achievement IDs for UI notifications
- Manager automatically registers all achievements on creation
- Depth tracking only updates to maximum (never decreases)
